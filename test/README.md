# Testing Files

## test.json

Sample json data for RandomTable objects that try to use all the possible format variations and features.

## test_randomizer.json

Tests the randomizer module as much as possible. Some of these tests failing may be an indication of a problem with the random table module (since some of the randomizing relies of results from tables). Uses the test.json data for sample tables.

## test.js

Once set-up right we'll try to automate testing of all those format variations and features.
