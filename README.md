# rpg-table-randomizer
Module for random tables for use in roleplaying games.

This is model and logic only there is no ui and only the most limited of view data. No functions are provided for the organization or storage of table data. (I'm working on a webapp that will provide views, ui, and storage.)

## Installation

This module was written for use in nodejs but uses browserify to create a module that can be used in browser. Babel is used to convert ES2015 features, but I haven't tested in most browsers.

-npm install
-browser install

## Usage

The module exports a few object and functions.
